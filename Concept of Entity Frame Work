////////////////////////What is Entity Framework
"Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET applications. 
It allows developers to interact with databases using .NET objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
EF simplifies data access by providing a bridge between the database and the applicationâ€™s domain model."

//////////////////////// Key Features of Entity Framework
Code-First Approach: Define your database structure using C# or VB.NET classes, and EF will generate the database schema.
Database-First Approach: Reverse-engineer an existing database into a .NET model.
Query Support: Use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for database operations.
Change Tracking: Automatically tracks changes made to objects and updates the database accordingly.
